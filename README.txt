Study about local adaptation on flowering phenology in the perennial plant Gentiana pneumonanthe in response to seed predation by the butterfly Phengaris alcon.

Data comes from plants cultivated in a common garden at Stockholm University. These plants were grown from seeds from 20 (<) different populations of Gentiana pneumonanthe located in the county of Västra Götaland (Sweden). The butterfly seed predator was present in half of these populations and absent from the other half. 

We expect to find differences among populations in flowering phenology in the common garden, with plants from populations where the predator is present flowering later than those where the predator is absent.
